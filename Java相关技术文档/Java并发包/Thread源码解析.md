# 简介

每个线程都有一个优先级，优先级高的先执行，优先级低的后执行。每个线程都可以创建一个新的线程，新的线程优先级默认跟创建它的线程一致。只有守护线程可以创建守护线程。

## 守护线程

Java程序入口就是由JVM启动`main`线程，`main`线程又可以启动其他线程。当所有线程都运行结束时，JVM退出，进程结束。

如果有一个线程没有退出，JVM进程就不会退出。所以，必须保证所有线程都能及时结束。

但是有一种线程的目的就是无限循环，例如，一个定时触发任务的线程：

```java
class TimerThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            System.out.println(LocalTime.now());
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

如果这个线程不结束，JVM进程就无法结束。问题是，由谁负责结束这个线程？

然而这类线程经常没有负责人来负责结束它们。但是，当其他线程结束时，JVM进程又必须要结束，怎么办？

答案是使用守护线程（Daemon Thread）。

守护线程是指为其他线程服务的线程。在JVM中，所有非守护线程都执行完毕后，无论有没有守护线程，虚拟机都会自动退出。

因此，JVM退出时，不必关心守护线程是否已结束。

如何创建守护线程呢？方法和普通线程一样，只是在调用`start()`方法前，调用`setDaemon(true)`把该线程标记为守护线程：

```java
Thread t = new MyThread();
t.setDaemon(true);
t.start();
```

在守护线程中，编写代码要注意：守护线程不能持有任何需要关闭的资源，例如打开文件等，因为虚拟机退出时，守护线程没有任何机会来关闭文件，这会导致数据丢失。

### 小总结

* 守护线程是为其他线程服务的线程；

* 所有非守护线程都执行完毕后，虚拟机退出；

* 守护线程不能持有需要关闭的资源（如打开文件等）。

## 线程的状态

Thread的状态有6中，它把就绪状态和运行状态都归为RUNNABLE了，下面状态图细分了一下

<div align="center"> <img src="https://gitee.com/wardseptember/images/raw/master/imgs/20201210215313.png" width="600"/> </div><br>

>注意：
>
>调用obj.wait()的线程需要先获取obj的monitor，wait()会释放obj的monitor并进入等待态。所以wait()/notify()都要与synchronized联用。

## 阻塞与等待的区别

阻塞：当一个线程试图获取对象锁（非java.util.concurrent库中的锁，即synchronized），而该锁被其他线程持有，则该线程进入阻塞状态。它的特点是**使用简单，由JVM调度器来决定唤醒自己，而不需要由另一个线程来显式唤醒自己，不响应中断**。
等待：当一个线程等待另一个线程通知调度器一个条件时，该线程进入等待状态。它的特点是**需要等待另一个线程显式地唤醒自己，实现灵活，语义更丰富，可响应中断**。例如调用：Object.wait()、Thread.join()以及等待Lock或Condition。

　　需要强调的是虽然synchronized和JUC里的Lock都实现锁的功能，但线程进入的状态是不一样的。**synchronized会让线程进入阻塞态，而JUC里的Lock是用LockSupport.park()/unpark()来实现阻塞/唤醒的，会让线程进入等待态**。但话又说回来，虽然等锁时进入的状态不一样，但被唤醒后又都进入runnable态，从行为效果来看又是一样的。

# 源码

源码也不是很复杂，native方法比较多

## start()

新启一个线程执行其run()方法，一个线程只能start一次。主要是通过调用native start0()来实现。

```java
 /** 该方法可以创建一个新的线程出来，返回的仍然是主线程
 * 启动线程，线程状态从 NEW 进入 RUNNABLE
 *
 * @exception  IllegalThreadStateException  if the thread was already
 *               started.
 * @see        #run()
 * @see        #stop()
 */
public synchronized void start() {
    /**
     * This method is not invoked for the main method thread or "system"
     * group threads created/set up by the VM. Any new functionality added
     * to this method in the future may have to also be added to the VM.
     *
     * A zero status value corresponds to state "NEW".
     */
    if (threadStatus != 0)
        throw new IllegalThreadStateException();

    /* Notify the group that this thread is about to be started
     * so that it can be added to the group's list of threads
     * and the group's unstarted count can be decremented. */
    // 将当前线程加入到所在的线程组，记录为活跃线程
    group.add(this);

    boolean started = false;
    try {
        // 这里会创建一个新的线程，执行完成之后，新的线程已经在运行了，既 target 的内容已经在运行了
        start0();
        started = true;
    } finally {
        try {
            // 如果失败，把线程从线程组中删除
            if (!started) {
                group.threadStartFailed(this);
            }
        } catch (Throwable ignore) {
            /* do nothing. If start0 threw a Throwable then
              it will be passed up the call stack */
        }
    }
}

private native void start0();
```

## run()

run()方法是不需要用户来调用的，当通过start方法启动一个线程之后，当该线程获得了CPU执行时间，便进入run方法体去执行具体的任务。注意，继承Thread类必须重写run方法，在run方法中定义具体要执行的任务。

## sleep()

sleep方法有两个重载版本：

```java
sleep(long millis)     //参数为毫秒

sleep(long millis,int nanoseconds)    //第一参数为毫秒，第二个参数为纳秒
```

sleep相当于让线程睡眠，交出CPU，让CPU去执行其他的任务。

但是有一点要非常注意，**sleep方法不会释放锁**，也就是说如果当前线程持有对某个对象的锁，则即使调用sleep方法，其他线程也无法访问这个对象。

## yield()

调用yield方法会让当前线程交出CPU权限，让CPU重新调度，也有可能重新选中自己。**它跟sleep方法类似，同样不会释放锁**。但是yield不能控制具体的交出CPU的时间，另外，yield方法只能让拥有相同优先级的线程有获取CPU执行时间的机会。

注意，调用yield方法并不会让线程进入阻塞状态，而是让线程重回就绪状态，它只需要等待重新获取CPU执行时间，这一点是和sleep方法不一样的。

## join()

join方法有三个重载版本：

```java
// 等待线程运行完
public final void join() throws InterruptedException {
    join(0);
}
// 使该方法的调用者所在的线程进入 WAITING 或 TIMED_WAITING 状态，直到当前线程死亡，或者等待超时之后，再去执行上述调用者线程
join(long millis)     //参数为毫秒
join(long millis,int nanoseconds)    //第一参数为毫秒，第二个参数为纳秒
```

join()实际是利用了wait()，只不过它不用等待notify()/notifyAll()，且不受其影响。它结束的条件是：1）等待时间到；2）目标线程已经run完（通过isAlive()来判断）。

```java
    public final synchronized void join(long millis)
    throws InterruptedException {
        long base = System.currentTimeMillis();
        long now = 0;

        if (millis < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("timeout value is negative");
        }
		//0则需要一直等到目标线程run完
        if (millis == 0) {
            while (isAlive()) {
                wait(0);
            }
        } else {
            // 如果目标线程未run完且阻塞时间未到，那么调用线程会一直等待。
            while (isAlive()) {
                long delay = millis - now;
                if (delay <= 0) {
                    break;
                }
                wait(delay);
                now = System.currentTimeMillis() - base;
            }
        }
    }
```

## interrupt()

```java
    public void interrupt() {
        if (this != Thread.currentThread())
            checkAccess();

        synchronized (blockerLock) {
            Interruptible b = blocker;
            if (b != null) {
                interrupt0();           // Just to set the interrupt flag
                b.interrupt(this);
                return;
            }
        }
        interrupt0();
    }
```

此操作会将中断线程，并重置中断标志位，至于线程作何动作那要看线程了。

- 如果线程sleep()、wait()、join()等处于等待状态，那么线程会定时检查中断状态位如果发现中断状态位为true，则会在这些阻塞方法调用处抛出InterruptedException异常，并且在抛出异常后立即将线程的中断状态位清除，即重新设置为false。抛出异常是为了线程从等待状态醒过来，并在结束线程前让程序员有足够的时间来处理中断请求。
- 如果线程正在运行、争用synchronized、lock()等，那么是不可中断的，他们会忽略。

可以通过以下三种方式来判断中断：

1)isInterrupted()

此方法只会读取线程的中断标志位，并不会重置。

```java
    public boolean isInterrupted() {
        return isInterrupted(false);
    }
```

2)interrupted()

返回线程是否被中断过，会重置中断标志位

```java
    public static boolean interrupted() {
        return currentThread().isInterrupted(true);
    }
```

此方法读取线程的中断标志位，并会重置。

3)throw InterruptException

抛出该异常的同时，会重置中断标志位。

/**
 * A <i>thread</i> is a thread of execution in a program. The Java
 * Virtual Machine allows an application to have multiple threads of
 * execution running concurrently.
 * <p>
 * Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher priority are
 * executed in preference to threads with lower priority. Each thread
 * may or may not also be marked as a daemon. When code running in
 * some thread creates a new <code>Thread</code> object, the new
 * thread has its priority initially set equal to the priority of the
 * creating thread, and is a daemon thread if and only if the
 * creating thread is a daemon.
 * <p>
 * When a Java Virtual Machine starts up, there is usually a single
 * non-daemon thread (which typically calls the method named
 * <code>main</code> of some designated class). The Java Virtual
 * Machine continues to execute threads until either of the following
 * occurs:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The <code>exit</code> method of class <code>Runtime</code> has been
 *     called and the security manager has permitted the exit operation
 *     to take place.
 * <li>All threads that are not daemon threads have died, either by
 *     returning from the call to the <code>run</code> method or by
 *     throwing an exception that propagates beyond the <code>run</code>
 *     method.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * There are two ways to create a new thread of execution. One is to
 * declare a class to be a subclass of <code>Thread</code>. This
 * subclass should override the <code>run</code> method of class
 * <code>Thread</code>. An instance of the subclass can then be
 * allocated and started. For example, a thread that computes primes
 * larger than a stated value could be written as follows:
 * <hr><blockquote><pre>
 *     class PrimeThread extends Thread {
 *         long minPrime;
 *         PrimeThread(long minPrime) {
 *             this.minPrime = minPrime;
 *         }
 *
 *         public void run() {
 *             // compute primes larger than minPrime
 *             &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre></blockquote><hr>
 * <p>
 * The following code would then create a thread and start it running:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     PrimeThread p = new PrimeThread(143);
 *     p.start();
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * The other way to create a thread is to declare a class that
 * implements the <code>Runnable</code> interface. That class then
 * implements the <code>run</code> method. An instance of the class can
 * then be allocated, passed as an argument when creating
 * <code>Thread</code>, and started. The same example in this other
 * style looks like the following:
 * <hr><blockquote><pre>
 *     class PrimeRun implements Runnable {
 *         long minPrime;
 *         PrimeRun(long minPrime) {
 *             this.minPrime = minPrime;
 *         }
 *
 *         public void run() {
 *             // compute primes larger than minPrime
 *             &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre></blockquote><hr>
 * <p>
 * The following code would then create a thread and start it running:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     PrimeRun p = new PrimeRun(143);
 *     new Thread(p).start();
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Every thread has a name for identification purposes. More than
 * one thread may have the same name. If a name is not specified when
 * a thread is created, a new name is generated for it.
 * <p>
 * Unless otherwise noted, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
 * or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be
 * thrown.

     * {@code stackSize} parameter, if any, is highly platform dependent.</b>
     *
     * <p>On some platforms, specifying a higher value for the
     * {@code stackSize} parameter may allow a thread to achieve greater
     * recursion depth before throwing a {@link StackOverflowError}.
     * Similarly, specifying a lower value may allow a greater number of
     * threads to exist concurrently without throwing an {@link
     * OutOfMemoryError} (or other internal error).  The details of

     * platform-dependent.  <b>On some platforms, the value of the
     * {@code stackSize} parameter may have no effect whatsoever.</b>
     *
     * <p>The virtual machine is free to treat the {@code stackSize}
     * parameter as a suggestion.  If the specified value is unreasonably low
     * for the platform, the virtual machine may instead use some
     * platform-specific minimum value; if the specified value is unreasonably
     * high, the virtual machine may instead use some platform-specific
     * maximum.  Likewise, the virtual machine is free to round the specified
     * value up or down as it sees fit (or to ignore it completely).
     *
     * <p>Specifying a value of zero for the {@code stackSize} parameter will
     * cause this constructor to behave exactly like the
     * {@code Thread(ThreadGroup, Runnable, String)} constructor.
     *
     * <p><i>Due to the platform-dependent nature of the behavior of this
     * constructor, extreme care should be exercised in its use.
     * The thread stack size necessary to perform a given computation will
     * likely vary from one JRE implementation to another.  In light of this
     * variation, careful tuning of the stack size parameter may be required,
     * and the tuning may need to be repeated for each JRE implementation on
     * which an application is to run.</i>
